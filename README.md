# Genshin Impact: Wish On Stream GUI
## âš  This repository has been included in the main script and will no longer be updated. You may go to the main project at [honganqi/GenshinWishOnStream](https://github.com/honganqi/GenshinWishOnStream).
This is the GUI frontend to the Genshin Impact: Wish On Stream
browser script meant for Twitch channel point rewards. You may
also get the bundle with the script already included.

## About
~~This is an optional GUI (graphical user interface) application
to authenticate and customize the Genshin Impact: Wish On Stream
browser source.~~ Please get the bundle (the one with the script
included) to save yourself the headache of downloading this GUI
and that script separately. 

## Requirements
* The Genshin Impact: Wish On Stream browser script

## Usage
* Upon first use, you will see the `Settings` page where you can
point the `Path to Genshin Wisher` to where your
`Genshin_Wish.html` file is. You will see the other sections
afterwards.

first time to use this, you will be redirected to Twitch and
will be asked to give permission to this script. After you give
your permission, you can close this browser.
